## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** 3.10 or higher ([install guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install))
- **Dart SDK** 3.10 or higher (bundled with Flutter)
- **Xcode** 15+ (for iOS builds on macOS)
- **CocoaPods** (for iOS plugins — install via `brew install cocoapods`)
- **A Supabase project** (free tier works — [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
- **Node.js 20+** (only needed if working on Edge Functions)

---

### 1. Clone & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Echo-Mirror-Butler/Echo-Mirror-Butler-.git
cd Echo-Mirror-Butler-

# Install FVM
dart pub global activate fvm

# Use the pinned version
fvm install
fvm flutter --version # should show 3.41.7

# Run all dart commands via fvm
fvm flutter pub get
```

---

### 2. Set up your Supabase project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free project (or ask the project lead to be added to the existing one).
2. In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **Project Settings → API**.
3. Copy two values:
   - **Project URL** — looks like `https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co`
   - **anon / public key** — a long JWT string

> **Never commit these values to git.** They are passed at runtime via `--dart-define`.

---

### 3. Store your credentials locally

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` on Linux):

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key-here"
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### 4. Run the app

**Terminal:**
```bash
fvm flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Pro" \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=$SUPABASE_URL \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=$SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

**VS Code (recommended):**

A `.vscode/launch.json` is already set up. It reads `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from your environment automatically. Just press **F5** after step 3.

> **iOS note:** If you see a CocoaPods warning on first run, run `pod install --project-directory=ios` then try again.

---

### 5. Optional: AI features (Gemini)

AI insights require a Google Gemini API key set as a Supabase Edge Function secret. Without it the app falls back to mock data — everything else works normally.

```bash
supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
```

---

### 6. Optional: Stellar testnet gifting

The gifting feature runs against the Stellar testnet — no real funds involved. No extra setup is needed to use it; wallet creation and testnet funding happen automatically in-app.

If you are working on the **backend/server** routes, copy the example env file and fill in your testnet keypairs:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# edit backend/.env with your STELLAR_ISSUER_* and STELLAR_DISTRIBUTOR_* keys
```

---

## 🏛️ Architecture

EchoMirror Butler follows a strict **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern with feature-based organization.

### Project Structure

```

### Key Patterns

- **MVVM**: Separation of data, view, and business logic
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer
- **Provider Pattern**: Riverpod for state management
- **Feature Modules**: Self-contained, modular features

## 💸 Stellar Integration & Gifting

EchoMirror Butler is built on the **Stellar blockchain**, using it as the backbone for all in-app gifting and token transfers. Users create Stellar wallets within the app and can send XLM (Stellar's native token) to each other as a way to show support, celebrate milestones, or just brighten someone's day.

### How Gifting Works

1. **Wallet Creation** — When a user signs up, a Stellar keypair is generated and linked to their account. The app stores the public key for receiving gifts and securely manages the secret key for signing transactions.
2. **Sending Gifts** — Users can gift XLM to any other user in the app. The sender selects a recipient, enters an amount, and the app builds and submits a Stellar payment transaction on their behalf.
3. **Live Session Gifting** — During real-time video calls (powered by Agora), users can send Stellar gifts to the person they're on a call with — making the connection feel more personal and rewarding.
4. **Gift History** — Every transaction is tracked in-app with status chips (pending, completed, failed), timestamps, and sender/receiver details. Users can pull to refresh and see their full gift history.

### Stellar Testnet

All development and testing is done against the **Stellar Testnet**, so no real funds are involved during development. The app uses the Stellar Friendbot to fund testnet wallets automatically. Moving to mainnet is a configuration change — the transaction logic stays the same.

### Tech Details

- **Stellar SDK for Flutter** — Handles keypair generation, transaction building, and submission
- **Horizon API** — Queries account balances, transaction history, and network status
- **XDR Encoding** — Transactions are encoded and signed client-side before submission
- **Supabase Backend** — Edge Functions coordinate gift records and map Stellar transactions to user accounts

## 🤖 AI Integration

EchoMirror Butler uses **Google Gemini AI** to generate personalized insights:

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: You log daily entries (mood, habits, notes)
2. **Pattern Analysis**: AI analyzes your recent logs (last 7-14 days)
3. **Insight Generation**: AI generates predictions, suggestions, and letters
4. **Display**: Insights appear in beautiful cards on your Dashboard

### AI Features

- ✅ **Pattern Detection**: Identifies trends in mood, habits, and notes
- ✅ **Predictions**: Realistic 1-month outcome forecasts
- ✅ **Suggestions**: Actionable habit improvements
- ✅ **Future Letters**: Empathetic motivational messages

### Privacy & Offline Mode

- **Works Offline**: App functions fully without API key (uses mock data)
- **Secure**: API key stored as a secret in Supabase
- **Private**: Your data never leaves your server
- **Graceful Fallback**: Errors never break the app

For AI setup instructions, refer to your Supabase dashboard or use `supabase secrets set` to add the `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret.
